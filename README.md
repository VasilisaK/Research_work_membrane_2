# Research_work_membrane_2
Classical method and multilayer method program for modeling a circular fabric-based membrane deflection effected by a cargo with asymmetric position over membrane center. 
The deflection modeling based on experimental data on the membrane deflection to find out the value at any given point on its surface. The model was formed on a relatively small experimental points sample. Neural network modeling approximate solution plot program is added. Programming language is Matlab.
Generating data samples is added.
